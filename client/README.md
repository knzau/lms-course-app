# Next.js Express Node.js App

This is a starter template for building a fullstack web application using Next.js, Express, and Node.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
